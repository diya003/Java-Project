# India SkyConnect
## CLI Airline Reservation System (Core Java)

India SkyConnect is a robust, feature-rich Command Line Airline Reservation System built entirely using core Java.  
It simulates a real-world airline booking experience directly inside the terminal using ANSI escape codes, CSV-based persistence, and role-based access control.

---

## Overview

India SkyConnect provides a graphical-like terminal interface for airline management without using any external frameworks or databases.

The system handles the complete lifecycle of an airline reservation platform:
- User authentication and registration
- Flight search and booking
- Seat allocation and fare calculation
- Ticket generation and cancellation
- Administrative analytics and management

This project is suitable for academic submissions, system design demonstrations, and Java OOP showcases.
